# Death by the Second

"Death by the Second" parses the locations of champion deaths, and outputs a .swf file which time-lapses the deaths throughout the game based on an interval specified by the user. Uncomment the bottom line to test it out! 

## Results
[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3Wig6ukVmdlREEySDYydHBMRHc/view?usp=sharing), you can find a product with 60 second intervals over the course of one bucket of games.

Alternatively, [here's](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3Wig6ukVmdlZGVYeUR0N0hKS0E&authuser=0) a slower version. This animation was created from data gathered from 24 URF endpoint calls.

## How it Works
The main_parse method iterates over a list of match IDs, and then subsequently map out the deaths based on the specified interval stated by using the draw_deaths method. For aesthetics sake, deaths persist past a single frame, and can span to 3 frames. Given a time in epoch seconds which works with the URF endpoint, a number of runs, and an interval (default to 1 minute), the call to main_parse will create a .swf of the deaths in the bucket.
